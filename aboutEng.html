				 <h3>About me</h3>
				 <p>My name is Hristina Ivova and I am an event photographer and photographer of individual photo sessions. I enjoy both being the eye of the event and interacting actively with my subjects during individual shoots. I am fascinated by the authenticity of human joy. I have a human approach to people and an artistic approach to photographs. 
					During events, my goal is to capture natural reactions and details and to cover all the participants and everything happening so that the final result is a full photo story which will later speak to you.
					I am curious about every new situation and it is a challenge for me to find  all the various possibilities to cover it. 
					During individual photo sessions, I interact sincerely with my subject/subjects, I look for their personal charm and I involve then into play in order to get the most natural expression. 
					I am open to shooting not only the things present in my portfolio, but also every other type of event or subject. 
					I have excellent spoken and written command of English and French. 
					</p>
